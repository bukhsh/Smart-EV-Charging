# Optimal Charging Scheduling of Electric Vehicles

This work develops an optimisation framework for optimal charging schedule of electric vehicles (EVs). The problem is solved for a given time horizon within which the EVs connect to an electricity distribution network to charge with an initial state of charge. The EVs are required to charge at the end of a flexibility window. The optimisation model determines the charging pattern within the flexibility window depending on the choice of an objective function.
